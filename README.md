# bigmoney-ui
A standalone user-friendly front end for the 'Ban Big Money' API.  This is a rapid prototype that does not include the standard <head> element from dogwood's site.

## To view
From the root folder of this repo:
`npm install http-server -g`
`http-server .`

## A note on ES6
This project uses ES6 and Babel to compile to ES5. Scripts with names ending in 'ES5' are autogenerated by Babel and will be overwritten.

To modify or add scripts:
- Run `npm install` to install node modules.
- Create or edit your script `script.js`
- Run `babel script.js --out-file scriptES5.js`

Note that Babel may need to be installed globally for the compilation command to work properly.
