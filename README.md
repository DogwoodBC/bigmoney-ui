# bigmoney-ui
A standalone user-friendly front end for the 'Ban Big Money' API.  This is a rapid prototype that does not include the standard <head> element from dogwood's site.

## To view
From the root folder of this repo:
`npm install http-server -g`
`http-server .`

## A note on ES6
This project uses ES6, Babel and Webpack to compile to ES5. Scripts with names ending in 'ES5' are autogenerated by Babel and will be overwritten; therefore they are no longer included in version control.

To modify or add scripts:
- Run `npm install` to install node modules.
- Create or edit your script `script.js`
- Run `webpack -w` to have Webpack compile in watch mode

Note that Webpack may need to be installed globally for the compilation command to work properly.
